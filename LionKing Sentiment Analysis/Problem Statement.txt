King (2019)” with at least the following features.

You are required to collect 3000 reviews only.
You are free to collect any other attributes/features that you think helpful.

2. Label the Review Sentiment:
You must label the data based on the following condition on Rating:
if ‘Rating’ > 3 then positive review else negative review – Create target attribute with
the name: “sentiment” (binary class)
